### travel-time cube analysis

This repo includes scripts for analyzing and visualizing travel-time cubes,

**T = [ t<sub> i j m</sub> ]**

Travel-time cubes are three-dimensional arrays of calculated shortest travel times **t** from origins **i** to destinations **j** at different departure times **m**.

These scripts in particular were built for analyzing transit accessibility in Toronto.

Scripts are setup for analyzing data stored as .csv, but can probably be manipulated for other data types.
